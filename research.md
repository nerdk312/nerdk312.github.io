I am a PhD researcher at the University of Bristol under the supervision of Professor Jonathan Lawry and Dr Raul Santos-Rodriguez focusing on using self-supervised learning for out-of-distribution detection.

Before coming to Bristol, I completed an MSc in Advanced Mechanical Engineering and a BSc in Chemistry at Implerial College London.
