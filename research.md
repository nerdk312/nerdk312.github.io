## Contrastive Learning with autoregressive decoder
Implemented a contrastive learning algorithm (AMDIN) which uses a pixelCNN decoder.
[[Code]](https://github.com/CompletedProjects/AMDIM_Decoder)


## Multimodal VQ-VAE
Implemented a multi-modal VQ-VAE which takes in RGB and infrared image data into a joint latent space which can then be used to decode the differnet modalites.[[Code]](https://github.com/CompletedProjects/Multimodal_VQ-VAE)

## Adversarial Learning in a  Predator-Prey game
Training a predator and prey in a simultaenosuly using reinforcement learning and examining the learning dynamics of the agents by fitting decision trees to the policies learnt by the different agents.
